## A Program by Garrison Mullen

*To demo this program, download the .html file included and open it in a web browser. No terminal-based localhost server setup needed yay*

[This is a single-file and otherwise equivalent version of another repository of the same name, pared down to this format so that any one of you can just load the .html file into a browser and see everything in action.]

I just wanted to make something cool and small that can be used to throw a little skyscape onto the screen. 
Hence, here's a project I spent 8-10 hours on, in which I learned about threeJS and some basic 3D stuff, and got to make something cool with it.

Features:

- The clock on screen will sync to whatever system time it grabs from your device.
- The background will update periodically with different colors to represent the changing sky during sunset/night times.
- On hover, the clock will expand to roughly 140% its size for improved legibility.
